# AnisotropicDiffusionEstimate


This Julia package is designed to estimate two translational diffusion coefficients and one rotational diffusion coefficient from the trajectories of an ellipsoid's center of mass of anisotropic diffusion, incorporating error estimation. It employs a particle filter implementation of the belief propagation method, based on maximum likelihood estimation. For further details, please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15909). A simple executable example can be found at [here](https://github.com/taka255/AnisotropicDiffusionEstimate/tree/main/examples/).
